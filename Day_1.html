- HTML: It provides all the Nouns of thr webpage
-CSS: Provides all the adjectives of the webpage
-Java Script: provides the verb/functioning of the webpage

<b> Learnt about the essentials of HTML: </b>

HTML is a markup language- A good way to think about it is: what a teacher does to a text written by student- It annotates and adds up on it- marks up on it. 
HTML is Hyper-text markup language with a goal to beautify the simple text with elements- Bold, underline etc.

<b>Mozilla Developer Network:</b> Its like Wikipedia for developers by developers. Here is the link- <i> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ </i>
