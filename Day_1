Leanrt that a websiteis designed by three languages:
- HTML: It provides all the Nouns of thr webpage
-CSS: Provides all the adjectives of the webpage
-Java Script: provides the verb/functioning of the webpage

Also installed VS Code to the computer and made mt first VS code file- which was just a text file though xD

Super Excited for the next Day!
